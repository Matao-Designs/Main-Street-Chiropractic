      question: 'Q: Once I go to the chiropractor do I have to for the rest of my life?',
      answer: 'A: No. Dr. Julie will set you up with a treatment plan to get your body functioning properly again. While wellness or maintenance care is suggested and encouraged it is up to you if youâ€™d like to continue your care after you are feeling better. '
    },
    {
      question: 'Q: How long will it take to get me better?',
      answer: 'A: Length of care depends on a lot of factors including how long the problem has been there, the cause of the problem, and other factors that will all be addressed during your initial exam. '
    },
    {
      question: 'Q: How much does it cost? ',
