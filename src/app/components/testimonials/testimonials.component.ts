    { name: 'Cathy W.', testimonial: 'Dr Julie is amazing. She has a plethora of treatment modalities so that if one isnâ€™t optimum, another fits the bill. I have visited quite a few chiropractors closer to my home, but have never had the results that Dr Julie is able to achieve. The long drive is worth it!' },
    { name: 'Cara A.', testimonial: 'I went to Dr. Julie when I was in the most pain while 9 months pregnant. My sciatica was excruciating and still trying to work full time. Dr. Julie impressed me before I even walked in the door. She promptly emailed me back on a weekend with her earliest appointment options. My first appointment was amazing and though it would take time to make the sciatica feel better, I was able to walk out of there with a little less pain. I saw her for the rest of my pregnancy and now my newborn and I both get adjusted. Give Main Street Chiropractic Center in armada a try. You will not be disappointed.' }
